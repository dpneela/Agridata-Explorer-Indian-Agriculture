# 🌾 AgriData Explorer
Agricultural Data Analysis using SQL, Python & Power BI

This project explores India’s agricultural landscape using Python (EDA), SQL (Queries), and Power BI (dashboards).
It analyzes 50+ years of state & district-level crop data to discover patterns in production, yield, and cultivated area, helping identify top regions, trends, correlations, and growth behavior.

# ⭐ Key Features
**Python:**

* Removed duplicates & missing values through pandas

* Conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in Python

* Bar, Line, and Pie charts using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

* Correlation analysis between area cultivated and production.


**SQL Queries:**

* Extracted insights such as top crop-producing states/districts, year-wise growth trends, yield efficiency, etc.


**Power BI Dashboards:**

* Visualized trends of crop production over 50 years and filters for year, state.

* Charts: Line, Bar, Stacked Area, Pie, Donut, and Map visuals.

* Insights like “Top 10 states/districts in production/yield”
